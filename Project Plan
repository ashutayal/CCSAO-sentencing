2. How likely is the initial charge to be changed depending on race?

Plan:
1. Upload the datasets and conduct any necessary cleaning of the data.

3. Run the following regression:
    independent variable: race of defendant
    dependent variable: charge at disposition
    control variables: judge, district, age, gender, year
4. Interpret results of regression
5. Create a variable to determine if the charge changed from initiation to disposition
6. Run the following regression:
    independent variable: race of defendant
    dependent variable: dummy variable indicating change in charge
    control variables: judge, district, age, gender, year
5. Graphically display the relationship between race and charge over time
